# hephestos2

These are my Simplify3D Profiles for the bq Hephestos 2 printer. 
The (modified) Version is the one i'm using. The other one is directly from the Simplify3D support and was sent to me on request. They claimed it's kind of beta-status so bear in mind that the profiles are not perfect.

I change my profile in the software a little bit for each print (Support, Speed, etc)
